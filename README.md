Backend implementation handling models and routes for `Review`s, `Profile`s, and more.

Server frontend can be found at parent repository: https://github.com/SamuelMarks/rust-actix-diesel-auth-scaffold (clone this one directory above to build)

## Why

Honestly everything else is too complicated. When you just want some access tokens and to get started real quick, this is what you need.

Once the server is up—setup/usage notes follow—you can just:
```sh
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/token \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       -H 'Accept: application/json' \
       -d '{"grant_type": "password", "username": "user", "password": "pass"}'
```

Which—registering user if nonexistent—returns of the form:
```json
{
    "access_token": "user::regular::access_token::4151d642-eb27-4064-b87c-e3d2bfa10435",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600
}
```

Then you can use this the regular way, for example:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3000/secured/secret \
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer user::regular::access_token::4151d642-eb27-4064-b87c-e3d2bfa10435'
```

## Docker usage

Install Docker, and then run the following, which will make a server available at http://localhost:3000:
```sh
$ docker compose up
````

NOTE: You may need to configure this for your architecture first, for example:
```sh
$ docker compose build --build-arg ARCH_VARIANT='amd64' \
                       --build-arg ARCH='x86_64'
$ docker compose up
```

Or to work with just one image and provide your own database and redis:
```sh
$ docker build -f 'debian.Dockerfile' -t "${PWD##*/}"':latest' .
$ docker run -e DATABASE_URL="$RDBMS_URI" \
             -e REDIS_URL='localhost:6379' \
             -p '3000:3000' \
             --name 'serve_api' \
             "${PWD##*/}"
```

## Native usage

Install Rust, `git`, and ensure you have your PostgreSQL and Redis/Valkey services setup.

### Environment setup

Add an `.env` file or otherwise add these environment variables; replacing connection strings with what you use:

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://rest_user:rest_pass@localhost/rest_db
    REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1/

### Execute

    cargo run

#### `--help`

    Usage: serve-actix-diesel-auth-scaffold [OPTIONS]
    
    Options:
          --hostname <HOSTNAME>  Hostname [env: SADAS_HOSTNAME=] [default: localhost]
      -p, --port <PORT>          Port [env: SADAS_PORT=] [default: 3000]
          --no-host-env          Avoid inheriting host environment variables
          --env-file <ENV_FILE>  Env file, defaults to ".env"
      -e, --env <ENV>            Env var (can be specified multiple times, like `-eFOO=5 -eBAR=can`)
      -h, --help                 Print help
      -V, --version              Print version

## Contribution guide
Ensure all tests are passing [`cargo test`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html) and [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) has been run. This can be with [`cargo make`](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make); installable with:

```sh
$ cargo install --force cargo-make
```

Then run:
```sh
$ cargo make
```

Finally, we recommend [feature-branches](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html) with an accompanying [pull-request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
